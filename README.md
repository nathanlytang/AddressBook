# Contact Directory

## Final Project
This program is an address book created in Python, using Tkinter for its GUI.  It allows the user to add, edit, and delete contacts.  Options include: First name, surname, phone number, email, address, and birthdate.


## Current Known Bugs
1. If only numbers are entered into the dialog boxes, they cannot be deleted with the delete button/function.  They can only be deleted via the CSV file.  Letters or symbols in combination with numbers will work fine.
